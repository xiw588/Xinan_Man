## Variable Selection Before EDA
After a thorough literature review, potential diagnostic and non-diagnostic predictors of MCI reversion to CN were chosen a priori for preliminary EDA and prediction modeling for MCI reversion at two years from baseline. These factors have previously been implicated in either MCI reversion or conversion, and include the following: 

1) Demographic characteristics: age, gender, ethnicity, race, education, and marital status;
2) Clinical factors: baseline blood glucose level, baseline homocysteine level, history of stroke, and history of hypertension (Sachdev, 2013);
3) Lifestyle factors: baseline smoking and alcohol abuse;
4) Neurocognitive/neuropsychological assessments: baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) scores (including RAVLT Learning, Immediate Recall, and Percent Forgetting), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) Delayed Recognition score, AVLT Delayed Recall score, Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS) 11-item/13-item progression model, Trail Making Tests A and B, Animal Fluency Test, Clinical Dementia Rating score (CDR-SB), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) (Ewer, 2012; Sachdev, 2013; Park, 2015). These tests assess different facets of cognitive performance, including daily functional ability, severity of cognitive impairment, verbal learning and fluency, and memory; 
5) Neuroimaging data: baseline fluorodeoxyglucose 18F uptake on brain positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Park, 2015);
6) Biomarkers: baseline Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β 1 to 42 peptide (Aβ42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau (Sachdev, 2013; Thomas, 2017; Park, 2015);
7) Genetic data: APOE4 genotype (Sachdev, 2013; Thomas, 2017; Park, 2015).

## Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 
The Washington University Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) is a global assessment instrument that yields global and Sum of Boxes (SOB) scores, with the global score regularly used in clinical and research settings to stage dementia severity.The utilization of CDR-SOB scores for staging dementia severity offers several advantages over the global score because the optimal characteristics of both scores can be combined into a single score. 
1) CDR-SOB scores are much simpler to calculate than the global score and they do not require an algorithm for computation, which will ultimately result in fewer calculation errors for those not using the online system.
2) CDR-SOB scores can be treated as interval data in statistical analyses, whereas global CDR scores are ordinal by the nature of the algorithm approach to condensing the data.
3) The advantage to using CDR-SOB scores for staging of dementia severity is the increased precision afforded for tracking changes across time.

Measurement of CDR:
The CDR is obtained through semistructured interviews of patients and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The CDR-SOB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. The CDR demonstrates good reliability11,12 and has been validated against neuropathologic finding13–15.
