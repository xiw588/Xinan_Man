## Introduction of Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that results in a loss of mental function caused by the deterioration of brain tissue. Symptoms includes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. The number of Americans living with Alzheimer's is growing fast. An estimated 5.7 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's in 2018, and over 96% are people older than 65 years old and approximately 200,000 individuals under age 65 who have younger-onset Alzheimer's. Alzheimer’s Disease is the only top 10 cause of death in the United States that cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed. MCI, a high-risk condition for dementia, is regarded as a transitional state between cognitive normal (CN) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). MCI is also classified as early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI). Early diagnosis of AD or MCI is really important in the following aspects. First, it could revoke the attention of patients and their family so that additional levels of care and intervention could be given. Second, it could help optimize resource allocation and save time for specific and targeted treatment. Third, it would provide more insights on the treatment of other diseases or combination treatment since most of the AD patients are older than 65 years old and it is very likely they are simultaneously suffering other diseases. Therefore, the aim of this project is to build predictive model for early diagnosis using a wide range of predictors including socio-demographic, clinical, genetic, imaging characteristics, and biospecimen biomarkers.
